# alarm-clock
My first ever Python project. I want to develop an alarm clock for me, so then I can wake up on time to go to work!

The different parts I will need to develop a clock is: 
  1. Day of the week
  2. Hour:Minutes PM/AM
  3. Month/Day/Year
  4. User to be able to input a time they want it go off
  5. I want alarm ot have a sound that goes off for 10 seconds.
